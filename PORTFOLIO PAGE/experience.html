    <article>
        2 YEARS AGO, I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE WORLD OF PROGRAMMING.
        BUT NOW, AS I DIVE DEEP INTO THE DEVELOPMENT THING, I AM BECOMING AWARE OF MANY NEW THINGS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT OF AS POSSIBLE.
        IT ALL HAPPENS WHEN ONE SHOWS CURIOSITY AND IS EAGER TO LEARN.
        SO, KEEP LEARNING.
